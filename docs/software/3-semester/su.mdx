## Learning Objectives

### Knowledge

The student must achieve knowledge on the following theories and methods.

**Object-oriented modeling in analysis and design:**

- Modeling of context (problem domain and application domain)
- Object-oriented concepts: class, object, events, structures, function, use cases, components,
  and component architecture
- UML: class diagram, state chart diagrams, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams

**Modeling with patterns:**

- Patterns for modeling the problem domain and application domain
- Patterns for connection of components
- Including analysis patterns: item-descriptor, hierarchy, stepwise role, material, and procedure
- Including design patterns: composite, layered architecture, observer, client-server, and
  model-view-controller

**System development method:**

- Waterfall and model-driven development
- Iterative method and prototype-driven method

### Skills

The student must achieve the following skills:

- Be able to explain precisely and use relevant concepts and modeling language
- Be able to model requirements for a system, its context and its different parts
  (model, functions, and interfaces)

### Competences

The student must be able to use the concepts, the patterns and the modeling language
to describe a concrete system that solves a well-defined task.
