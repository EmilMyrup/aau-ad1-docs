## Learning Objectives

### Knowledge

The student must achieve knowledge on the following theories and methods.

**Object-oriented modeling in analysis and design:**

- Modeling of context (problem domain and application domain)
- Object-oriented concepts: class, object, events, structures, function, use cases, components,
  and component architecture
- UML: class diagram, state chart diagrams, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams

**Modeling with patterns:**

- Patterns for modeling the problem domain and application domain
- Patterns for connection of components
- Including analysis patterns: item-descriptor, hierarchy, stepwise role, material, and procedure
- Including design patterns: composite, layered architecture, observer, client-server, and
  model-view-controller

**System development method:**

- Waterfall and model-driven development
- Iterative method and prototype-driven method

### Skills

The student must achieve the following skills:

- Be able to explain precisely and use relevant concepts and modeling language
- Be able to model requirements for a system, its context and its different parts
  (model, functions, and interfaces)

### Competences

The student must be able to use the concepts, the patterns and the modeling language
to describe a concrete system that solves a well-defined task.

## System Development

We wil primarily work with design and methods. This is in regards as to how to produce a system
design without significant uncertainties, but also applying methods as guidelines for carrying
out system development activities.

The book provided in this course covers the guidelines for work processes in relation to both
design and methods.

### Difficulties associtated with System Definition Elements

- One can confuse the difference between **Functionality** and **Responsibility**
  - Functionality: The system functions that sipport the application-domain tasks.
  - The system's responsibility in relation to its Administrative tool.
- The difference between **Techonology** and **Conditions**
  - The conditions clearly clarify the conditions under which the system will be
    developed and used.
