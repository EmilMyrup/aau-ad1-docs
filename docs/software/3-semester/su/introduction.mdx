The first lectures gives an introduction to the course and its content, and presents
the first activity of the method. More precisely you will get:

1. A general presentation of the key activites in systems development, with examples.
2. A presentation and discussion of the main concepts of the OOA&D method.
3. A Presentation of the System Choice activity in OOA&D.

## Readings

Chapter 1 & 2.

## Objects in Analysis and Design

### Analysis

Phenomena **outside the computer system**. Makes use of "identity" to identify an object, but also its behavior,
which tracks the events an object has performed or suffered.

### Design (and implementation)

Phenomena **inside the computer system**. Makes use of "identity" to get acces to an object, whereas the
behavior keeps track of the operations an object can perform on request and offers to other objects.

## The OOA&D Method

### Purpose

- To determine system requirements.
- To produce a system design without significnat uncertainties.
- To understand a system, its context, and the conditions for its implementation.

### Concepts

- Objects
- Classes
- Problem domain: That part of a context that is administrated, monitored, or controlled by a system
- Application domain: The organization that administrates, monitors, or controls a problem domain.
- System: A collection of components that implements modelling requirement functions, and interfaces.

### Principles

- Model the context.
- Emphasize the architecture.
- Reuse patterns.
- Tailor the method to suit specific project.

### Results

- An analysis document and a design document.

### Section 1.9, Exercise 1

> What is the difference between objects and classes?

An **Object** is an entity with identity, state, and behaviour.
A **Class** is a description of a collection of objects sharing structure,
behavioural pattern, and attributes.

In _analysis_ an object is an abstraction of a phenomenon in the system's context,
such as a customer. A specific customer is treated as a single entity with an
identity, state, and behaviour. Opposed to objects acting as a single entity will classes act as a container for multiple objects. Instead of describing each particular
object, the class functions as a shared object description for all objects in the same
class.

### Section 1.9, Exercise 4

> Why should systems developers understand the context of the systems they are designing?

A key task in analysis and design is to model what the system will administrate,
monitor, or control. System developers should analyze the problem domain, both to understand the system's context and to learn how to usefully representing it to the system's users. A second key task in analysis and design is to model how the system will interact with users in the application domain. This includes identifying all user groups and understanding both what they will use the system for and how each group will interact with the system in different situations. However, users and system developers interpret things in different ways thus system development requires a common understanding between the developer and user. OOA&D focuses on this challenge.

### Section 1.9, Exercise 5

> How can you distinguish between a system's problem domain and application domain?
> Can they partly overlap?

The system's context can be viewed from two complementary perspectives: the system models something (the problem domain) and it is operated by users (the application domain). We define them as following:

- **Problem domain:** _That part of a context that is administrated, monitored or controlled by a system_.
- **Application domain:** _The organization that administrates, monitors, or controls a problem domain_.

To establish a clear separation between the two you could think of it as being: The problem domain is part of the real world and consists of entities that exists in the real world. The application domain consists of software entities in the implementation of the solution. However, they need to be tighly connected to fully resemble the problem domain.

### Section 2.10, Exercise 2

> What is a system definition and how is it used?

A **system definition** is a concise description of a computerized system expressed in a natural language. It seeks to describe the system in context, what information it should contain, which functions it should provide, where it is to be used, and which development conditions apply. Furthermore, it should be brief and precise, and contain the most fundamental decisions about the system.

The system definition is produced by iterating through the three subactivities:

1. **Situation:** Focuses on challenges.
2. **Ideas:** Create and evaluate ideas.
3. **Systems:** Formulate and choose system definition.

To describe the situation in the first subactibity one could apply the usage of **Rich Pictures**, which focuses on important aspects of a given situation. This enables participants to get ideas and bring creativity into the project.

The result of the second subactivity is a collection of ideas, but in order to establish and evaluate ideas in operation with the users, one could make use of _exemplars_, _metaphors_, and _experiments_. The most important are probably exemplars in the form existing solutions, and experiments in the form of prototypes.

The purpose of the third and final subactivity is to choose the actual system to develop. After thoroughly creating and evaluating new ideas based on Rich Pictures, exemplars, or prototypes, it is time to decide on an actual system definition. The definition describes a totality, or a whole. It will therefore express emergent, system-focus properties, rather than detailed, component-oriented properties.

### Section 2.10, Exercise 9

> What are the elements in the FACTOR criterion for system definition?

The **FACTOR criterion** consists of six elements:

- **Functionality:** The system functions that support the application-domain tasks.
- **Application domain:** Those parts of an organization that administrate, monitor, or control a problem domain.
- **Conditions:** The conditions under which the system will be developed and used.
- **Technology:** Both the technology used to develop the system and the technology on which the system till run.
- **Objects:** The main objects in the problem domain.
- **Responsibility:** The system's overall responsibility in relation to its context.

The FACTOR criterion can be used in two ways:

1. Use it to support system-definition development.
2. Start the definition by describing the system and then use the criterai to see how the system definition satisfies each of the six factors.
