## Architectural Design

When referring to the system model, we are referencing the above listed figure.
This is different from the original application/problem domain model, which is
needed when we are talking about interfaces, functions and the model within the
system.

### Key Concepts
_System_: A collection of components that implements modelling requirements, functions,
and interfaces.

_Architecture_: A general structure that is later developed further.

### Two Views
![Architectural Design: Two Views](images/architectural-design-two-views.png)

The two views consists of _component_ and _process_ architecture.

#### Component architecture
- classes
- Stable aspects
- Related components
- Logical level
- Structure for descriptions

#### Process architecture
- Objects
- Dynamic aspects
- Coordination of processes
- Physical level
- Strucutre for execution

### Objects in Analysis and Design

It is important to state the clear difference of objects depending of the current
stage of development. In this case analysis and design.

#### Analysis
- Phenomena outside the computer system
- Identity: identifies an object
- State: the quality that characterize an object
- Behaviour: the events an object have performed or suffered

#### Design
- Phenomena inside the computer system
- Identity: gets acces to an object
- State: the values of the object's attributes and object structures
- Behaviour: the operations an object can perform on request and offers to the
other objects (methods)

### Activities

## The Criteria activity

### Result

The end result is a collection of prioritized criterias for the given system.
A collection of criterias could look like something listed below:

![Criteria result](images/architectural-design-criteria-result.png)

It is important to emphasize what is more and less important. Not all
criterias can be prioritized as equally important.

### Key Concepts
For OOA&D we work with the following key concepts when talking about criterias:

Usability
- The system as a whole
- The user's needs
- The technical platform

Flexibility
- Consequences of changes
- Modular design

Comprehensibility
- Overview
- Abstraction
- Use of patterns

### Activities

## The Components activity

### Result

The final result of creating and organizing components is a _structural perspective_,
which _separates concerns in a system_ to _emphasize comprehensibility and flexibility_.

![Components result](images/architectural-design-components-result.png)

### Key concepts

#### Component

A list of components can be seen as a collection of program parts, which functions
as LEGO blocks to build the system. It constitutes a totality and has a
well-defined responsibility.

Component wise is the smallest possible a __class__ and the largest is a __system__.

As an example on the below image we see a component that has the responsibility
for reading the buttons and updating the display

![Components result](images/architectural-design-component-example.png)

#### Activites

![Components activities](images/architectural-design-components-activites.png)

### Patterns

#### The Layered Architecture

![Layerered architecture](images/architectural-design-layered-architecture.png)

The __layer__ describes a component's responsibility by the oprations it provides
to a layer above and those that are applied from the layer below.

The __part__ is that there is no substantial interaction with other parts in the
same layer.

For __closed architecture__ we only apply operations from an adjacent layer.

For __open architecture__ we apply opeartions from any other layer.

When working with __strict architecture__ one should only apply operations
from a layer below.

In __relaxed architecture__ you should apply operations from the layers both
above and below.

For __strict architecture__ one should apply operations on the layer placed both
above and below the actual layer.

### The Generic Architecture

![Generic architecture](images/architectural-design-generic-architecture.png)

The __generic architecture__ reflects the actual division of the context into
problem domain and application domain. An example of this would be a single
DanKort terminal.

> Consider the design of a specific system with respect to each of the classical
> criteria in figure 9.1 (page 180). How can you practically assess the system's quality
> with respect to each of the criteria? Indicate the expected outcome of such
> an assessment for each of the criteia. Suggest design improvements based
> on this assessment.

### Exercise 8 (page 189)
> Analyze the general criteria for design in Figure 9.1. Identify those pairs
> of criteria that can be combined and that conflict or need to be balanced.

The possible pairs of criteria:

- Comprehensible & Usable
- Efficient conflicts with everything else
- Combine Interoperable, Reusable, Portable and Flexible
- Combine Maintainable & Comprehensible
