# Usage

We have recently worked with what the system will consist of,
but in this lecture we will focus on the output of the specific
program/application.

## Summary
### Purpose
To determine how actors interact with a system.

### Concepts
* Actor: An abstraction of users or other systems
that interact with the target system.
* Use case: A pattern for interaction between the system
and actors in the application domain.

### Principles
* Determine the application domain with use cases.
* Evaluate use cases in collaboration with users.
* Assess social changes in the application domain.

### Results
Descriptions of all use cases and actors.

## Usage Activity

### Results
The result is a **Actor table**, which consists of
different actors. When we work with actors we typically
create **use cases** to describe the specific case of using
the product/application.

### Key Concepts
#### Actor
Identify actors:
* Determine the distribution of roles of the works tasks
related to the system.
  * It is important to figure out the different
  areas of works tasks to specifically be a able to tie a unique
  actor to the correct works tasks. This is typically how the
  use case is set up.
* Consider human actors and other systems as actors.

Describe actors:
* Make actor specification.

Example of a actor specification:

#### Use Case
One can sufficiently build use cases from either **text** or
**statechart diagrams**. The preferred method when talking
to client is the use case build from text since this is more
descriptive for non-technical users.

Use cases should be simple and constitute a coherent whole.
The description of actors and use cases should provide
uderstanding and overview. Use cases should be described in
enough detail to enable identification of functions and
interface elements.

> Withdrawel (refer to the image above)

Functions:
* Register amount withdrawel
* Validate
  * Card
  * PIN code
* Check balance

User Interface:
* Keyboard
* Display (window)
  * PIN code
  * Amount
  * Approval

## Differences between Actors and Classes
|         | Application domain | Problem domain        |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Static  | Actors             | Classes and structure |
| Dynamic | Use cases          | Behavioral patterns   |
