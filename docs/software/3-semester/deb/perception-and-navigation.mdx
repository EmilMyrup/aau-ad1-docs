## Group Exercises

### Exercise 1
> Design your user interface to support the patterns related to user perception.
> Describe which patterns you used and the considerations made.

By looking at the NewOrderView one can quickly recognise three “columns”.
The columns are separated by additional space to indicate separate entities.
The contents of these columns are grouped together so that the user knows
they are alike - proximity. Furthermore, textboxes are styled identically.

All food items look alike no matter what view is active. This allows the
user to recognise the pattern - recognise rather than recall.

#### Proximity
On the order receipts, the elements are grouped to ease the visual perception
of the user. Textboxes are placed closer to each order than they are to other
elements. The white space and proximity makes it so, that the user sees
these elements as related.

#### Similarity
The various food items are made almost identical with the exception
of an icon, which illustrates the category of the food item. Through
similarity, the user sees these elements as cohesive. If one has
experience with one element, one can manage all others.

#### Chunking
Views are split up in chunks that frames, which view corresponds to a specific
task. The NewOrderView is split up in categories, choice of product, and the
final receipt of the order.

#### Continuity
We use scrollbars each time a list has more content than can be shown on
the screen at once. In scrollable lists the last element overflows
and only a small part of it is visible. This indicates
that more content is available.

Every chunk has no broken lines so the readers always read from left to right
and top to bottom.

#### Depth Perception
Element drop shadows give the impression of three dimensions.
This is not necessary application-wise but looks pretty cool I suppose.

#### Common Region

#### Closure
Well, if you take a look at the NewOrderView one can quickly recognise
three “columns” or rectangles. In the lists, each line forms a
rectangle with its elements without explicitly outlining the shape.
This gives a sense of closure.

### Exercise 2
> Design your user interface to include navigation signs.
> Describe which signs you used and the considerations made.

In several of the pages (views) we use highlight menu tabs to allow
the user to easily backtrack. We also designed each page with a heading,
to show the user that a particular destination has been reached.

Navigational items - namely sidebar menu tabs - are clearly separated
from the main content. They are grouped together in boxes and the color
of said boxes are different from the background color of the main content.

Navigation follows the Apple guidelines. There is only one path that
takes you to a given destination and each path is designed to be logic.
An example of this is the edit order destination. The path to get
here is my orders → specific order → edit order.
