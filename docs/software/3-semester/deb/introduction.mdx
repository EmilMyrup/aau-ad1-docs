## Group exercises
For this session, select one system with which you have had a poor
experience (web application, desktop application, mobile app etc.) and
consider the following:

**Program/application of choice**: Steam

> What is the aim of the system?

The aim of the system is to provide a central social platform for socializing and
playing together with your fellow peers. Thusmore, this provides the service of
having all your games in one platform, where it's possible to distribute and sell
more games, in which they enforce users to stay on this platform.

> Who are the target users?

Men in the span of 10 - 25 years, who plays video games. The overall design of the
system is dark, which appeals to people sitting at night time, for a comfortable
sitting, whilst enjoying their games.

> What activities is the system supposed to support, and in which context(s)?

Purchase, install and administrate games, chat with friends. The system provides
a platform for a wide variety of games of all genres.

> Why did the use of the system lead to a poor experience?

Slow to use. The design is not intuitive. The platform makes a fair attempt at
encourage the aspect of socializing but this is not the highest priority in which
they emphasize the game store and game library much higher.

The design is outdated (not following current trends) and the platform has
implemented a browser in their "store", which seems like a cheap solution considering
it's very slow and doesn't improve the overall experience of browsing video games.

> How would you improve this?
