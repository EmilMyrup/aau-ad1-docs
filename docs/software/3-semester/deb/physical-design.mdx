## Nielsens Heuristics

### Visibility of system status
The system should always keep users informed about what is
going on, through [appropriate feedback](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visibility-system-status/)
within reasonable time.

> __Definition__: The visibility of system status refers to how well the state of
> the system is conveyed to its users. Ideally, systems should always
> keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate
> feedback within reasonable times

### Match between system and the real world
According to [this article](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/match-system-real-world/)
from nngroup the system should speak the users' language, with words,
phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.
Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural
and logical order.

### User control and freedom
Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need
a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state
without having to go through an extended dialogue.
Support undo and redo.

### Consistency and standards
Users should not have to wonder whether different words,
situations, or actions mean the same thing.
Follow [platform conventions](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/do-interface-standards-stifle-design-creativity/).

> __Summary__: Standards ensure a consistent vocabulary, but don't
> limit designers' freedom (and responsibility) in deeper design issues.
> Also: Guidelines for writing design standards.

It is important to implement design standards based on
already known [mental models](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/)
of the users. What users believe they know about a UI strongly impacts
how they use it. Mismatched mental models are common, especially
with designs that try something new.

### Error Prevention
Even better than good error messages is a careful design which
[prevents a problem](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/slips/) from
occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions
or check for them and present users with a confirmation
option before they commit to the action.

> __Summary__: Slips are common errors that happen when users do
not pay full attention to a task or have small memory lapses.
Preventing errors of this type is largely a matter of reducing
burdens on users and guiding them when precision is required.

You can explore strategies to [prevent users from making mistake](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-mistakes/)
where their goals have been erroneously formed from a poor
model of the interface.

### Recognition rather than recall
Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions,
and options visible. The user
[should not have to remember information](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/)
from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for
use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable
whenever appropriate.

> __Summary__: Showing users things they can recognize improves
usability over needing to recall items from scratch because
the extra context helps users retrieve information from memory.

### Flexibility and efficiency of use
Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up
the interaction for the expert user such that the system
can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users.
Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

### Aesthetic and minimalist design
Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely
needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes
with the relevant units of information and diminishes
their relative visibility.

### Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
[Error messages](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/error-message-guidelines/)
should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the
problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

> __Summary__: Established wisdom holds that good error messages
> are polite, precise, and constructive. The Web brings a few new
> guidelines: Make error messages clearly visible, reduce the work
> required to fix the problem, and educate users along the way.

### Help and documentation
Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation,
it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such
information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task,
list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

## Group Exercises

### Exercise 1
> Design all the icons (that you are aware of so far) illustrating functionality
> within your semester project system: that is, icons used to activate the
>  functionalities. Apply Hortons icon checklist to inform your designs
> and discuss why you use particular items on the checklist while
> other may be less prioritized.

### Exercise 2
> In the physical design you are making now, consider how you will design
> for all of Nielsens heuristics, e.g. “recognition rather than recall”,
> “visibility of system status” etc.
