overview: true
---

After taking this course, you should acquire the following
knowledge:

- Basic mathematical concepts such as recursion, induction,
  concrete and abstract complexity;
- Basic data structures;
- Algorithmic principles such as searching, search trees, sorting,
  dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer;
- Graphs and graph algorithms such as shortest path, connected
  components, spanning trees

After taking this course, you should be able to:

- Determine abstract complexity for specific functions;
- Conduct complexity and correctness analysis of algorithms,
  including recursive algorithms;
- Choose and use appropriate algorithms for standard tasks such as
  searching, sorting, and path finding.
