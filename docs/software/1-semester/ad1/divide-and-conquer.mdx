# Divide-and-Conquer

In this lecture, we look at the divide-and-conqure technique and
how to analyze divide-and-conqure algorithms. In particular, we will
look into Merge Sort, a sorting algorithm that follows the
divide-and-conqure principle.

## ILO of Lecture 3

After this lecture, you should be able to

- Understand the divide-and-conquer technique for algorithm design
- Analyze divide-and-conquer algorithms

## Divide-and-Conquer algorithms

### Basic idea of Divide-and-Conquer

**Divide** the original **big** problem into several sub-problems that are
similar to the original problem but **smaller** in size.

**Conquer** recursively until the sub-problem is a small problem size
that can be solved trivially.

**Combine** the solutions to sub-problems to create a final solution to the
original problem.

## Analyzing Divide-and-Conquer algorithms

### Recurrences

A **recurrence** is an equation or inequality that describes a function in terms
of its value on smaller inputs.

Assume that the division of the problem yields **_a_** sub-problems and each
subproblem is **_1/b_** the size of the original. This means we have:

#### Recurrence on Binary Search

![Recurrence](/images/divide-and-conquer-recurrence.png)

If we to the complexity of recurrences we see that:

- a = 1, since we need to find the middle index once.
- b = 2, we split up the original array into two new arrays divided on the middle.
- D(n) = $\theta (1)$, because we compute the middle index in constant time.
- C(n) = 0, since there is no need to combine the two arrays into the original one again.

This gives a time complexity of:

- $T(n) = \theta (1)$ if n = 1
- $T(\dfrac{n}{2}) + \theta (1)$ otherwise, i.e., if n > 1

### The Repeated Substitution Method

Solving recurrences with the repeated substitution method:

- Substitute
- Expand
- Substitute
- Expand
- ...

One should observe a **pattern** and write how your expression looks after the _i_-th
substitution.

### Lecture Exercise

$$
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + b \\
  = 2(2T(\dfrac{n/2}{2}) + b) + b = 2^2T(\dfrac{n}{2^2}) + (2+1)b \\
  = 2^2(2T(\dfrac{n}{2^3})) + b) + (2+1)b = 2^3T(\dfrac{n}{2^3}) + (2^2+2+1)b \\
  ... \\
$$

## Merge Sort

An algorithm that is able to solve the sorting problem and uses the Divide-and-Conquer
technique. One should assume that we are going to sort a sequence of numbers in
array A.

## Exercises

### Merge-Sort

> Run the merge sort algorithm on the following array of numbers:
> (3, 41, 52, 26, 38, 57, 49, 9). Give the state of the array
> after five calls of the algorithm Merge are performed during
> the execution of Merge-Sort.

### Divide-and-Conquer

> Consider an array $A[l..r]$ of integers, where $r - l + 1 = 2^k$; for some $k > 0$.
> Write a divide-and-conquer algorithm to find the two smallest numbers in this
> array.

```text
INPUT: an array of integers A[l..r], r - l + 1 = 2^k, for some k > 0
OUTPUT: (min1, min2), such that min1 <= min 2 and for each i
        ∈ [l..r], min1 ≤ A[i] and if A[i] 6= min1, then min2 ≤ A[i]

FIND2MINS(A, l, r)
  if r - l = 1 then return (min{A[l], A[r]}, max{A[l], A[r]})
  q <-- (l+r)/2
  (min1l, min2l) <-- FIND2MINS(A, l, q)
  (min1r, min2r) <-- FIND2MINS(A, q + 1, r)
  if min1l < min1r then return (min1l, min{min1r, min2l})
  else return (min1r, min{1l, min2r})
```

> Write a recurrence describing how many comparison operations your algorithms
> performs. Solve it to find the exact answer.

The recurrence for the number of comparisons (where $l - r = 1$ is not counted
as a comparison).

$$
T(2) = 1 \\
T(n) = 2T(n/2)+2, (n > 2).
$$

> What is the asymptotic worst-case running time of your algorithm?

The asymptotic worst-case running time is $\theta (n)$, which is the same as
that of the algorithm given for the same problem in lecture 1 exercises.

### Repeated substitution

> Try to write the recurrence for the recursive version of the factorial
> algorithm shown in the lecture. Try to use the repeated substitution method
> to solve the recurrence that you wrote.

![Exercise 3](/images/divide-and-conquer-exercise-3.png)

> What is the time complexity of the algorithm?

The time complexity for the above recurrence is:

$$
T(n) = 2^iT(\dfrac{n}{2^i})+(2^i-1)4 \\
= nT(1)+(n-1)4 \\
= \theta (n)
$$
