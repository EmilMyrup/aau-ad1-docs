# Introduction and System Choice

## Exam

- Written
- 2 hours
- All source of nodes allowed
- Internet connection is allowed

### Date

Friday january 3rd/4th.

## Course overview

- Object-oriented modelling in analysis and design
- Modelling with patterns
- Sys. Dev. methods
- Sys. Practices

## Primary goal

- Be able to apply concepts, patterns and modelling language to describe a specific system.

## System Development

We wil primarily work with design and methods. This is in regards as to how to produce a system
design without significant uncertainties, but also applying methods as guidelines for carrying
out system development activities.

The book provided in this course covers the guidelines for work processes in relation to both
design and methods.

### Difficulties associtated with System Definition Elements
* One can confuse the difference between **Functionality** and **Responsibility**
  * Functionality: The system functions that sipport the application-domain tasks.
  * The system's responsibility in relation to its Administrative tool.
* The difference between **Techonology** and **Conditions**
  * The conditions clearly clarify the conditions under which the system will be
  developed and used.

## Objects in Analysis and Design

### Analysis

Phenomena **outside the computer system**. Makes use of "identity" to identify an object, but also its behavior,
which tracks the events an object has performed or suffered.

### Design (and implementation)

Phenomena **inside the computer system**. Makes use of "identity" to get acces to an object, whereas the
behavior keeps track of the operations an object can perform on request and offers to other objects.

## The OOA&D Method

### Purpose

- To determine system requirements.
- To produce a system design without significnat uncertainties.
- To understand a system, its context, and the conditions for its implementation.

### Concepts

- Objects
- Classes
- Problem domain: That part of a context that is administrated, monitored, or controlled by a system
- Application domain: The organization that administrates, monitors, or controls a problem domain.
- System: A collection of components that implements modelling requirement functions, and interfaces.

### Principles

- Model the context.
- Emphasize the architecture.
- Reuse patterns.
- Tailor the method to suit specific project.

### Results

- An analysis document and a design document.

## Group Exercises

1. Test
2. **Select an existing system, which you know well. Describe the problem domain, application domain, model, function, and interfaces for this system.**
