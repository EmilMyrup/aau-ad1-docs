# Structure

This lecture presents the second activity in Object-Oriented Analysis,
more precisely you will get:

- A detailed presentation of the Structure activity (Chapter 4)
- A discussion of the different means for describing structure

## Summary of structures

### Purpose
To describe structural relations between classes and objects in a problem
domain.

### Concepts
Class structures
* Generalization: A general class (the super class) describes properties
common to a group of specialized classes (the subclasses).
* Cluster: A collection of related classes

Object structures
* Aggregation: A puperior object (the whole) consists of a number of
objects (the parts).
* Association: A meaningful relation between a number of objects.

### Principles
* Study abstract, static relations between classes.
* Study concrete, dynamic relations between objects.
* Model only the necessary structual relations.

### Results
The result is a class diagram with classes and structures.

## Key Concepts
The takeway from this section is that it is possible to have both a
generalization class and aggregation class on a parent class. Take for
instance a car. The `Car` class can consist of a generalization class
`Passenger Car` to describe the type of car and a aggregation class `Engine`
to specify, that the car has a engine. This is also visually shown in
[Cluster](#cluster).

### Generalization
![Generalization](/images/structure-generalization.png)

'is-a' relation.

It describes the relation between two classes.

### Cluster
![Cluster](/images/structure-cluster.png)

Clusters are a class structure to distinguish between the various
types of classes.

### Aggregation
![Aggregation](/images/structure-aggregation.png)

'has-a' or 'owns-a' relation.

Aggregation is about looking at the specific objects, and how they are connected
in relation to each other. This also specifies the amount of relations.

Typical aggregations:
* Whole - part
  * Example: a project group, and the parts are the students
* Container - contents
* Union - member

### Association
![Association](/images/structure-association.png)

Defines the relation between two objects, but is not as strongly described as
aggregation. It is usually on the same level.

## Activities
![Activities](/images/structure-activities.png)

## Evaluate Systematically
You can read more about aggregation versus association on page 87.

The structures must be simple, especially at the top levels. It is seen as good
practice to avoid unnescessary generalization and aggregations to keep it as
clean and descriptive as possible. This is also the reason for why one should
avoid objects changing class, since this require a total rework of the structure.

## Explore patterns

### Role
As en example it is possible for a person to have different roles. The roles for
a person can change dynamically over time.

### Relation
Used to identify if objects from to classes are related.

![Activities](/images/structure-relation.png)

### Hierarchy
Used to identify how objects from different classes form a hierarchy.

### Item-Descriptor
Properties of objects from one class (items) are described in an object
from another class (descriptor).


## Individual Exercises

### Quiz 3

#### Question 1
> Which pattern is this?
>
> ![Quiz 1](/images/structure-quiz-1.png)

It is a Descriptor-item pattern.

#### Question 2
> Match the three structures with the diagram
>
> ![Quiz 2](/images/structure-quiz-2.png)

- A. Generalization.
- B. Association.
- C. Aggregation.

#### Question 3
> Generalization is a structure that expresses that:

Specialized classes inherit properties from a super class, we have
and 'is-a' relation.

#### Question 5
> The following is/are object structure(s)

Association & Aggregation.

#### Question 5
> The Role Pattern

- Is a pattern concerned with structure.
- Let's a person change roles dynamically.

#### Question 6
> The following is/are class structure(s)

Cluster & Generalization.

### Section 4.8, exercise 3

> Why is multiplicity only specified on object structures?

Multiplicity defines how many objects participate in a relationship and it is the
number of instances of one class related to one instance of another class.
For each association and aggregation, there are two multiplicity decisions
to make, one for each end of the relationship. Multiplicity is represented
as a number and a `*` is used to represent multiplicity of many.

This is why it is only specified on object structures since it defines
relationship between objects of classes.

### Section 4.8, exercise 5

> What is the meaning of inheritance? How is it described?

Inheritance is a feature that represents the "is a" relationship between different
classes. Inheritance allows a class to have the same behavior as another class and
extend or tailor that behavior to provide special action for specific needs.

### Section 3.6, exercise 14

> Review the class diagram in Chapter 20 using the criteria for systematic
> structure evaluation from this chapter. Are the structural relations appropriately
> descibed? Suggest possible alternatives.

### Section 4.8, exercise 16

> _Mobile Phone_. Continue your considerations of the system for a simple mobile phone
> (see Exercise 3.14). Describe structural relations between classes and objects in a
> class diagram.
