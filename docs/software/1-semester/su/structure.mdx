# Structure

This lecture presents the second activity in Object-Oriented Analysis,
more precisely you will get:

- A detailed presentation of the Structure activity (Chapter 4)
- A discussion of the different means for describing structure

## Individual Exercises

### Quiz 3

### Section 4.8, exercise 3

> Why is multiplicity only specified on object structures?

Multiplicity defines how many objects participate in a relationship and it is the
number of instances of one class related to one instance of another class.
For each association and aggregation, there are two multiplicity decisions
to make, one for each end of the relationship. Multiplicity is represented
as a number and a `*` is used to represent multiplicity of many.

This is why it is only specified on object structures since it defines
relationship between objects of classes.

### Section 4.8, exercise 5

> What is the meaning of inheritance? How is it described?

Inheritance is a feature that represents the "is a" relationship between different
classes. Inheritance allows a class to have the same behavior as another class and
extend or tailor that behavior to provide special action for specific needs.

### Section 3.6, exercise 14

> Review the class diagram in Chapter 20 using the criteria for systematic
> structure evaluation from this chapter. Are the structural relations appropriately
> descibed? Suggest possible alternatives.

### Section 4.8, exercise 16

> _Mobile Phone_. Continue your considerations of the system for a simple mobile phone
> (see Exercise 3.14). Describe structural relations between classes and objects in a
> class diagram.
