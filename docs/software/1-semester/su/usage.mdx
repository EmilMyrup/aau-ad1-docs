# Usage

We have recently worked with what the system will consist of,
but in this lecture we will focus on the output of the specific
program/application.

## Summary
### Purpose
To determine how actors interact with a system.

### Concepts
* Actor: An abstraction of users or other systems
that interact with the target system.
* Use case: A pattern for interaction between the system
and actors in the application domain.

### Principles
* Determine the application domain with use cases.
* Evaluate use cases in collaboration with users.
* Assess social changes in the application domain.

### Results
Descriptions of all use cases and actors.

## Usage Activity

### Results
The result is a **Actor table**, which consists of
different actors. When we work with actors we typically
create **use cases** to describe the specific case of using
the product/application.

### Key Concepts
#### Actor
Identify actors:
* Determine the distribution of roles of the works tasks
related to the system.
  * It is important to figure out the different
  areas of works tasks to specifically be a able to tie a unique
  actor to the correct works tasks. This is typically how the
  use case is set up.
* Consider human actors and other systems as actors.

Describe actors:
* Make actor specification.

Example of a actor specification:

#### Use Case
One can sufficiently build use cases from either **text** or
**statechart diagrams**. The preferred method when talking
to client is the use case build from text since this is more
descriptive for non-technical users.

Use cases should be simple and constitute a coherent whole.
The description of actors and use cases should provide
uderstanding and overview. Use cases should be described in
enough detail to enable identification of functions and
interface elements.

Functions:
* Register amount withdrawel
* Validate
  * Card
  * PIN code
* Check balance

User Interface:
* Keyboard
* Display (window)
  * PIN code
  * Amount
  * Approval

## Differences between Actors and Classes
|         | Application domain | Problem domain        |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Static  | Actors             | Classes and structure |
| Dynamic | Use cases          | Behavioral patterns   |
