The result of well researched entities is an **Event Table**, which
clearly clarifies the major classes and events in the problem domain.

It functions as a checklist, to indicate the different events of the defined classes.

## Key Concepts

- Object and Class
- Event
  - An instantaneous incident involving one or more objects.
  - Its atomic, which means it can not be divided into sub-events.

## Activities regarding classes

![Activities regarding classes](/images/classes-activities-draw.png)

### Example from IKEA

> What are relevant events?

- Vare modtaget
- Vare solgt
- Vare skadet

Based on the above events it would be sufficient to define a class
**Vare**. There's many things which can define a product(vare) but
for this system will the above mentioned events be the most important.
We abstract from any other instances which are not defined.

## Find Candidates for Classes and Events

For classes:

- Look at nouns.
- Eliminate nouns.
- Describe a single instance (object).

For events:

- Look at verbs.
- Eliminate verbs related to the way users carry out their job.
- Indicate a single event. Avoid adding sub-events.

### Example: Hair Salon

|                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Functionality**      | Support for work planning and appointments                                                   |
| **Application domain** | Managing customer, their treatments, and appointments, and planning emplyees' work schedules |
| **Conditions**         | Developed in close cooperation with the employees                                            |
| **Technology**         | Smaller PC or Macintosh with a large graphical screen                                        |
| **Objects**            | Customer, employees, appointment, and work schedules                                         |
| **Responsibility**     | Tool for reliable administration and a common mediator                                       |

The correct answers are: Make an event table, Classify objects in the problem domain

### Question 2

> A system to be used to control train traffic at Aalborg Railway Station: Which of the following are events?

The correct answers are: A train passing a signal, A train passing a rail sensor, A train shifting track, A train crossing the rail bridge across the fjord, A train stopping at Aalborg Nord

The correct answers are: Identity, State, Behavior

### Question 4

> A system to be used to control train traffic at Aalborg Railway Station: Which statements are correct?

The correct answers are: A signal post and its signal is part of the PD, A signal post and its signal can be part of the AD, A signal post and its signal can be part of both PD and AD, but it depends on which functions we require, A train sensor on the rails can be part of the PD, A train sensor on the rails is not an object and neither part of the PD nor part of the AD because it is just an input device

The correct answers are: Atomic, An incident involving one or more objects, Instantaneous

### Question 7

> The system's model of the problem domain is:

The correct answers are: Represents the state of the problem domain, Provides information to users in the application domain about the problem domain

## Individual Exercises

### Section 3.6, exercise 4

> What is a common event?

A common event is an instantaneous incident involving one or more objects.

### Section 3.6, exercise 9

> What are the basic criteria for selecting classes and events?

#### Classes

As a rule, when you evaluate a class, you should be able to answer these questions affirmatively:

- Can you identify objects from the class?
- Does the class contain unique information?
- Does the class encompass multiple objects?
- Does the class have a suitable and manageable number of events?

You should always be able to identify objects from a class.

#### Events

When evaluating your event candidates, you should be able to answer:

- Is the event instantaneous?
- Is the event atomic?
- Can the event be identified when it happens?

An event should be defined as instantaneous in order to make it clear when it has occured.

### Section 3.6, exercise 10

> What is the result of the class activity?

As one would be writing down many candidates will provide one with a better overall picture. If this incidence
does not occur, then one might reject relevant candidates too soon. It is important to have a broad range of
potential candidates as it opens up a lot of edge cases and thereby select the correct classes to be the core of
your problem-domain.

### Section 3.6, exercise 15

> _Teaching administration_. Consider a system for monitoring student activities in a university department. The department
> offers its students courses and thesis projects. Each course follows one of several graded exams. The department must track all its
> activities, the teachers responsible for the activity, the student participating in the activity, and the results of the activity exams.
>
> Add details and assumptions as needed and address the following problems. List class candidates in the teaching administration system.
> Evaluate the the candidates systematically and produce the resulting event table.

## Group Exercises

### Compare and discuss the results of individual exercises 4 and 6.

> Compare and discuss the results of individual exercises 4 and 6.

### Section 3.6, exercise 16.

> Elevator control. Consider a system to control elevator movement in a building. Several processors keep track of movements and signals. There is one processor for each of the N elevators. It controls the engine and doors, and reads the push buttons and sensors associated with the elevator. There is one processor at each of the M floors. It reads the push buttons associated with the floor. Finally, there is one processor that controls all requests from all push buttons. Your solution can be centralized or decentralized, but it should meet the following requirements:
> - Each elevator has a button for each floor. The buttons are illuminated when pressed and cause the elevator to visit that floor.
> - Each floor has two buttons (except ground and top): one to request up-elevator and one to request down-elevator. The buttons illuminate when pressed and cancel when a suitable elevator visits the floor.
> - All requests for elevators from the different floor must be serviced eventually with all floors given equal priority.
> - All requests for floors from within elevators must be served eventually, with floors being serviced sequentially in the travel direction.
>
> Add details and assumptions as needed and address the following problems. 
> - List class candidates in the elevator control system.
> - List event candidates in the elevator control system.  
> - Evaluate the candidates systematically and produce the resulting event table.

### Start the analysis on your project (if you have chosen it)

> Make a first system definition by carrying out the activities described in Chapter 2.

> Carry out the Classes activity as described in Chapter 3.

> Reconsider your first system definition: was it useful for selecting classes and events or does it have to be refined.
