## Event table

![Classes Event Table](classes-event-table.png)

The result of well researched entities is an **Event Table**, which
clearly clarifies the major classes and events in the problem domain.

It functions as a checklist, to indicate the different events of the defined classes.

## Key Concepts
* Object and Class
* Event
  * An instantaneous incident involving one or more objects.
  * Its atomic, which means it can not be divided into sub-events.

## Activities regarding classes
![Activities regarding classes](classes-activities.png)

### Example from IKEA
> What are relevant events?

* Vare modtaget
* Vare solgt
* Vare skadet

Based on the above events it would be sufficient to define a class
**Vare**. There's many things which can define a product(vare) but
for this system will the above mentioned events be the most important.
We abstract from any other instances which are not defined.

## Find Candidates for Classes and Events
For classes:
* Look at nouns.
* Eliminate nouns.
* Describe a single instance (object).

For events:
* Look at verbs.
* Eliminate verbs related to the way users carry out their job.
* Indicate a single event. Avoid adding sub-events.

### Example: Hair Salon
![Example Hair Salon](classes-example-hair-salon-factor.png)

**Classes**
* FrisÃ¸r
* Elev
* Kunde
* Aftale

**Events**
* Kunde behandlet
* Kunde aflyst
* Kunde ankommet
* Betalt
* Ansat sygemeldt


## Quiz 2

### Question 1

> The following are core principles of the class activity:

The correct answers are: Make an event table, Classify objects in the problem domain

### Question 2

> A system to be used to control train traffic at Aalborg Railway Station: Which of the following are events?

The correct answers are: A train passing a signal, A train passing a rail sensor, A train shifting track, A train crossing the rail bridge across the fjord, A train stopping at Aalborg Nord

### Question 3

> An object in the problem domain is defined as an entity with:

The correct answers are: Identity, State, Behavior

### Question 4

> A system to be used to control train traffic at Aalborg Railway Station: Which statements are correct?

The correct answers are: A signal post and its signal is part of the PD, A signal post and its signal can be part of the AD, A signal post and its signal can be part of both PD and AD, but it depends on which functions we require, A train sensor on the rails can be part of the PD, A train sensor on the rails is not an object and neither part of the PD nor part of the AD because it is just an input device

### Question 5

> What are the results of the problem-domain analysis?

The correct answers are: A class diagram describing classes and structure, State-chart diagrams describing the behavior of objects in classes, An event table

### Question 6

> An event in problem domain analysis is:

The correct answers are: Atomic, An incident involving one or more objects, Instantaneous

### Question 7

> The system's model of the problem domain is:

The correct answers are: Represents the state of the problem domain, Provides information to users in the application domain about the problem domain

## Individual Exercises

### Section 3.6, exercise 4

> What is a common event?

A common event is an instantaneous incident involving one or more objects.

### Section 3.6, exercise 9

> What are the basic criteria for selecting classes and events?

#### Classes

As a rule, when you evaluate a class, you should be able to answer these questions affirmatively:

- Can you identify objects from the class?
- Does the class contain unique information?
- Does the class encompass multiple objects?
- Does the class have a suitable and manageable number of events?

You should always be able to identify objects from a class.

#### Events

When evaluating your event candidates, you should be able to answer:

- Is the event instantaneous?
- Is the event atomic?
- Can the event be identified when it happens?

An event should be defined as instantaneous in order to make it clear when it has occured.

### Section 3.6, exercise 10

> What is the result of the class activity?

As one would be writing down many candidates will provide one with a better overall picture. If this incidence
does not occure, then one might reject relevant candidates too soon. It is important to have a broad range of
potential candidates as it opens up a lot of edge cases and thereby select the correct classes to be the core of
your problem-domain.

### Section 3.6, exercise 15

> _Teaching administration_. Consider a system for monitoring student activities in a university department. The department
> offers its students courses and thesis projects. Each course follows one of several graded exams. The department must track all its
> activities, the teachers responsible for the activity, the student participating in the activity, and the results of the activity exams.
>
> Add details and assumptions as needed and address the following problems. List class candidates in the teaching administration system.
> Evaluate the the candidates systematically and produce the resulting event table.
