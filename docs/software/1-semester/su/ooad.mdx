## Individual Exercises

### Exercise 1 (page 299)

> Why is it important to develop a strategy for using OOA&D

The sults is a strategy that identifies the main activities, along with their priority
and execution order. The strategy points to needs for coordination during analysis and
design, and acts as the bases for making agreements among developes about the internal
distribution of responsibility.

### Exercise 2 (page 299)

> What does a strategy for using OOA&D determine?

A strategy prioritizes the identified activities, and determines their interplay. A key
aspect of OOA&D is describing the target system's properties. It is therefore very important
when and in what sequence you make decisions about the system. This is where a strategy
comes in to organize and plan the above mentioned sequence of decisions.

### Exercise 3 (page 299)

> Which types of conditions influence the strategy?

### Exercise 4 (page 299)

> Why should you focus on the difficult requirements and conditions?

The particularly problematic areas should be focused and tackled first. As these are
the primary problem areas one should make critical decisions about these areas first
and delay the less important ones until later. As we discuss the problematic areas
we may receal conditions that make it difficult or impossible to arrive at a
satisfactory system. The earlier we tackle them, the better.
