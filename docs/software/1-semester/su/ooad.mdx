title: OOA&D in Practice

## Individual Exercises

### Exercise 1 (page 299)

> Why is it important to develop a strategy for using OOA&D

The sults is a strategy that identifies the main activities, along with their priority
and execution order. The strategy points to needs for coordination during analysis and
design, and acts as the bases for making agreements among developes about the internal
distribution of responsibility.

### Exercise 2 (page 299)

> What does a strategy for using OOA&D determine?

A strategy prioritizes the identified activities, and determines their interplay. A key
aspect of OOA&D is describing the target system's properties. It is therefore very important
when and in what sequence you make decisions about the system. This is where a strategy
comes in to organize and plan the above mentioned sequence of decisions.

### Exercise 3 (page 299)

> Which types of conditions influence the strategy?

### Exercise 4 (page 299)

> Why should you focus on the difficult requirements and conditions?

The particularly problematic areas should be focused and tackled first. As these are
the primary problem areas one should make critical decisions about these areas first
and delay the less important ones until later. As we discuss the problematic areas
we may reveal conditions that make it difficult or impossible to arrive at a
satisfactory system. The earlier we tackle them, the better.

## Group Exercises

### Exercise 8 (page 299)
> Consider one of your recents projects. First, describe the strategy
> followed in the project.

Starting from our previous P1 project we made an outline containing headlines
for what the program should include and consist of. Based on this outline we
brainstormed the functions and made a vague time estimation. We also made a
flowchart for the program logic and constructed a Gantt-diagram to act as a
overview, time schedule and bearing. The workload was split and perfomed
according to the waterfall method.

> Design a strategy using the approach offered in the chapter.

**Guidelines for designing a strategy**
- Put highest emphasis on areas with great difficulty.
- Initiate activities in difficult areas early in the process.
- Make critical decisions first and less critical decisions later in the process.
- Design the strategt to ensure coordination of decisions.
- Include requirements management in the strategy.
- When necessary, attempt to alter development conditions to ensure
  a satisfactory system.

The strategy will put great emphasis on problematic areas with high difficulty.
- Database
- Interaction between orders
- Generate events for order checkout
- Intuitive user interface tailored to the userbase's different levels of competence
- Handling feedback from the prototype-phase

Focus lies on the application domain where the greatest challenges was found.
However, we will at first analyze the application domain and system architecture
to determine requirements.

Phase 1: Analysis of problem- and application domain.
Phase 2: Design system architecture and kernel components.
Phase 3: Implementation and development.
Phase 4: Continuous usability tests and redesign if necessary.
Phase 5: System development.
