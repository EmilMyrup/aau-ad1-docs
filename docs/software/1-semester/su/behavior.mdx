# Behavior

## Summary
### Purpose
To model the dynamics of a problem domain.

### Concepts
* Event trace: A sequence of events involving a specific object.
* Behavioral pattern: A description of possible event traces
for alle objects in a class.
* Attribute: A descriptive property of a class or an event.

### Principles
* Create behavioral patterns from event traces.
* Study common events.
* Derive class attributes from behavioral patterns.

### Results
* A behavioral pattern with attributes for every class in a
class diagram.


## Result
![Result](/images/behavior-result.png)

For the class we add a behavioral diagram that describes the current behavior of
the objects related to the class.

## Key concepts
### Event Traces
> A sequence of events involving a specific object.

One should make event traces for each class. This means that we for each class asks:
* Which event(s) cause the creaton of a problem-domain object?
* Which event(s) cause the disappearence of a problem-domain object?

Typical event traces includes:
* Which events occur together in a sequence?
* Are there any alternative events?
* Can a given event occur more than once?
* Is the overall form structured or unstructured.

#### Common Events: Event Table
![Event table](/images/behavior-event-table.png)

A `*` indicates that the event can occur multiple times, whereas
the `+` indicates that the event only happens once.

## Modelling techniques

### Consider Structures
Aggregation and association
* If two or more objects have common events, consider adding an aggregation
or association structure between them.
* If two classes are related by and aggregation or association structure,
at least one common event should be considered.

Generalization
* If the same event is tied to two classes, consider whether one class is
a generalization of the other.

### Hierarchical States
Consider using hierarchical states

### Describe Attributes
Class attributes:
* What are the general characteristics of the class?
* What basic data must be captured about objects from this class?
* What results from an event trace must be captured?

Event attributes:
* What time did the event occur?
* Which amount did it concern?
