## 1.2-1

> Provide an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at application level and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

Driving navigation.

## 1.2-2

> Comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on identical hardware. For inputs of size $n$, insertion sort requires $8n^2$ steps while merge sort requires $64n\lg n$ steps. For which values of $n$ is insertion sort more efficient than merge sort?

$$
\begin{aligned}
8n^2 & <   64n\lg n \\\\
 2^n & <   n^8 \\\\
   n & \le 43.
\end{aligned}
$$

## 1.2-3

> What is the smallest value of $n$ such that an algorithm with running time $100n^2$ is more efficient than an algorithm whose running time is $2^n$ using identical hardware?

$$
\begin{aligned}
100n^2 & <   2^n \\\\
     n & \ge 15.
\end{aligned}
$$
