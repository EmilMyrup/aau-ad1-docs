As of August 2019, the aaudoc is opening up for students attending AAU to build and
maintaining the biggest index of lecture notes, which can be used throughout
courses and exams.

Open Sourcing can be difficult and doesn't always come with the best reputation
for being welcoming, which is sad. **At aaudoc we believe that everyone benefits
from Open Source, and we are dedicated to make you feel welcome.**
