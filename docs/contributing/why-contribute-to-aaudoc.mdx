title: "Why Contribute to aaudoc?"
---

There are many benefits to contribute to aaudoc. Here are some of the benefits
of participating:

- **Grow your network.** Working with aaudoc can establish connections with people
  you may not have had a conversation with before. You can get help or give help
  to your fellow students and you might even establish new friendships.

- **Combine knowledge.** When you work on aaudoc you will inevitably learn more
  about a certain topic due to it being documented by a multiple different peer
  students. You all share the same starting point but how you interpret the new
  knowledge is the key to form a profound and well documented note hub. This can
  also be overwhelming due to each indiviual person having their own ways of acquiring
  new knowledge. Sharing is caring, and a combined resource of notes from a set of
  students is better than one, which hasn't been reviewed, discussed and approved.

- **Spaced repetition.** As changes are inevitably, one could repeatedly go over the
  suggested edits and give thought to the provided content. This means that you are
  retaining your knowledge far better with
  [spaced repetition](https://litfl.com/learning-by-spaced-repetition/). This utilises
  the spacing effect, which improves recalling your knowledge when needed. As one
  student suggests changes, your peer students uses
  [active recall](https://getatomi.com/staffroom/what-is-active-recall-and-how-effective-is-it/)
  to recall their acquired knowledge of a given topic, test themselves and either
  approve or decline your suggestion. It is proven that spaced repetition improves
  your recalling and thereby retain the content you processed much better, which
  is handy when exams are coming up.

- **Fast and reliant search.** The search functionality used on aaudoc is
  [DocSearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/) provided by
  [algolia](https://www.algolia.com/). The search functionality in documents
  provided by Microsoft Office or similar products is slow, unprecise and
  cumbersome. DocSearch will first search for exact matches in your keywords
  and then fallback to partial matches. This means that any letter, word
  or sentence is queryable instantaneously through the search functionality.
  Gone are the days where you can't find that one thing you were so desperately
  looking for.

- **Offline support.** What is online documentation worth, if you can't
  use it in your exams? Not much. Therefore aaudoc supports offline usage
  as a Progressive Web App ([PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/)).
  This means you can install aaudoc as an app, or access the contents right
  in your browser when you have no internet connection. This means that no
  matter where you are, you would always be able to access your notes.

There are without a doubt more benefits to contributing than the ones mentioned above.
