We want contributing to be educational, entertaining and satisfying. If you're
interested in participating in the aaudoc community, contributions are a bit
more than pull requests and commits. For the items listed below we are thrilled
to have any kind of contributions including:

- Submitting new lecture notes
- Submitting lecture notes updates, enhancements, designs, or bug fixes
- Submitting correction of spelling or grammar mistakes
- Searching for aaudoc on [Discord](https://discord.gg/bgBacJd) and helping
  someone else who needs help
- Teaching others how to contribute to the aaudoc's repo!
