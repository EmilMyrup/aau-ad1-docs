## Our Assurance

In the interest of welcoming as many new members as possible, we as contributers
and maintainers contribute to the friendly environment. It's our assurance that
the aaudoc community is a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of religion,
gender identity, age, body size, disability, level of experience or race.

## The High Five

To create a positive environment we refer to "The High Five" as good examples of behavior
to contribute to this matter.

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior
and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any
instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments,
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this
code of conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors
that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by
contacting the project team at [matnhansen@gmail.com](mailto:matnhansen@gmail.com)
