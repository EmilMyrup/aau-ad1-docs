title: "Solutions to Introduction to Algorithms Third Edition"
---

## Getting Started

This website contains solutions to the book [**Introduction to Algorithms** _Third Edition_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) by [Thomas H. Cormen](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/thomas-h-cormen), [Charles E. Leiserson](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/charles-e-leiserson), [Ronald L. Rivest](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/ronald-l-rivest) and [Clifford Stein](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/clifford-stein). The website is inspired by the already existing **[solution website](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/)** organized by [Jay Chen](https://github.com/walkccc).

The primary goal of this page is to aid students at AAU attending the AD1 course by assuring they have solved the problem exercises correctly. If this is not the case, one can study the problem solutions to aquire knowledge regarding their mistakes.

## Announcement

This page was originally an idea to provide students with already existing solutions. As development progressed, the primary goal shifted towards being a **Shared Note-Taking Platform**, where students can share their notes and educate others.

Therefore, please **do not hesitate to add valuable knowledge or correct any mistakes** if any adjustments is needed regarding the solutions. You can edit a page simply by pressing button **Edit on Github** located at the top of all pages to change its content.

## Shared Note-Taking

As students attend the same lectures, one could imagine that notes were duplicated. _**This is not efficient**_. One could argue that personal notes are strongly advised to acquire new knowledge, but imagine if **all students worked together to build a strong and revised platform** for lecture notes and solutions in general. This would be a strong foundation for **increased peer-learning** as topics will be revised, dicussed and explained in such manner, that anyone can benefit from it.

Thank you very much, and I hope that everyone will succeed in this course!

## How is this site generated?

I use the static site generator [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) by using markdown language by [MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/) to create pages and [GraphlQL](https://graphql.org/) to structure data.

Furthermore this page support [KaTeX](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-katex/) to allow using equations similar to LaTeX.
